# Needs-Based AI

## Introduction

![Needs in the sims 4](https://guides.gamepressure.com/thesims4/gfx/word/452402571.jpg)
In this project I want to make an AI that chooses which actions it should do to fullfill the needs of an agent.

This techinque is mostly used in simulation games, like the Sims, and can give your NPC a more realistic feel to them.

These needs that the agent has, will decay over time. To make sure that it doesn't drop to 0, an AI would have to choose between a few actions. These actions would then happen with a certain object.
These objects advertise whether it, for example, improves hunger. Using these advertisements, the AI can make a better decision as to what action would be best for the agent in it's current state.
